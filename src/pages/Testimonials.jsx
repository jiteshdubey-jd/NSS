        "One joins NSS in order to be altruistic and assist those around them, but I can guarantee with certainty that volunteering with this amazing FAMILY will help you become the best version of yourself. NSS is without a doubt our college's most formidable body, as evidenced by our effort and zeal, but don't mistake this strength for a lack of enjoyment. My time as a volunteer has been the most fun I've had in years. From debate competitions to Old age home visits, from blood donations to The ELECTRIC Sojourn Dance, NSS has given me a variety of settings and opportunities to strengthen my ability to balance my need to serve others with my need to have a good time. It is here that I have witnessed my efforts make a significant difference in the lives of the needy, as well as where I have witnessed perfect strangers become best friends. Aise hi nahi hum khudko family ka title dete hai, when I needed it, I had a stronghold of 200 volunteers on my side, which is what every college student hopes for. Even if my official volunteer status has ended (once a volunteer, always a volunteer), my connection to NSS simply grows deeper with time. I will be grateful to my dependable councils and my fellow volunteers forever and always.",

        " JAI HIND! Okaaay, so where should I even start? There is so much to say  about NSS but I doubt this feedback would be enough. NSS made me go out of my comfort zone- even before the projects, the recruitment process itself was so different from the others, we had to sing, dance, say dialogues, and whatnot. NSS not only gave me an opportunity to contribute to society but also learn how to be confident and deal with people. And how can we forget Sojourn, it will always be one of my favorite memories of NSS. As for the projects, there are too many to go on about, so I’m going to talk about my favorite project which was the ashram visit- it was such a wonderful experience seeing all the elderly laugh and enjoy with us. And as for my NSS family, the sense of unity will always be unmatched, you guys were the best! I would say these two years in NSS were the best I could ask for, I will miss my NSS family for sure and as they say ONCE A VOLUNTEER ALWAYS A VOLUNTEER",

        "Jai hind ! Pata nhi tha NSS ka pehela feedback yaha dene mila. From the day of recruitment, it was journey of fun and bonding, from being the Harry Potter, dancer, singer for my family everything I loved here. I also remember ki online me ghar me baith ke hume social activities karni padhi jo ki society me jhadu lagana ho ya raat ko baithke skit ki preparation ho ya road par awareness baatna ho sab ne mujhe kuch sikhaya aur banaya hai. Online ke wajh se seniors ke saat itna time spend karne nhi mila par jab mile tho bohot maze kiye humne saat me. Jab hum TE bane hum par responsibility aagayi thi ki hame humare SE ko bhi waise pyaar dena hai jese hume humare senior se mila, par humein kar dikhaya ek saat aakar recruitment ho ya sojourn dance sabme humne machaya hai. Mere zindagi ka pehela Camp aur sabse badiya camp, ek thali me khana ho ya ek saat masti karna sab aaj bhi yaad karne me hasi aati hai. Jab join kiya tha NSS me Discipline dekh ke laga tha kab khatam hoga ye NSS par aaj sochta hu kyu khatam hua ye NSS. This two year was gone too fast, that kabhi aisa lag rha hai abhi toh join kiye tha humne, par jese rajesh khana ji ne kaha hai babumoshai zindagi badi honi chaiye lambi nhi waise is safar ke 2 sunhere saalo ke raha par bohot saari yaadein batoor ke Jana padh rha hai. From being selfish person to thinking for society in the one-word feedback by me. I am proud to be NSS volunteer as it as given me the chance to contribute for society and for increasing and burning the spirit for serving the society. Once a Volunteer always a volunteer. ",

        "NSS'' whenever I hear this name I just remember my selection day, when everything was boring in online mode and I got this zoom link for nss selections. I went there and it was a totally different atmosphere altogether, where we used to get strong, got several tasks to do. And after entering NSS the first thing we all got introduced with was the word FAMILY. It was an incredible fun ride and the most lovely bond ever shared where we all really got along to help needy people, to enjoy ourselves after the project.Through NSS we all learned discipline, Punctuality, Values. As I'm talking about family bonds, I want to go back to some memories of NSS Camp. I Still Remember those days which were so evolving for all of us, most of us got along in those 7 days where we really got to know what exactly NSS is all about. The strictness, fun we had without spending a single time searching for mobile phones was awesome. It was fully a phone detoxification, we never thought there would be such fun in camp. It was Once in a lifetime moment, which will stay forever with us. It's emotional to write this last feedback when I really grew up from rookie in college to being Senior with NSS . I will end this feedback saying I Really Don't want this journey to end ever, As we say ONCE A VOLUNTEER ALWAYS A VOLUNTEER JAI HIND.",

        "Let's start from our selection. I was so excited to be a part of the NSS family. The fun began at the start of the recruitment days. While entering NSS when we were in SE we entered as an individual but after that we were made united by our Council and TE volunteers. From blood donation camp and old age home to actually Nss 7 days camp it was very daunting for me. Being a part of NSS not only made me aware of people's problems and their experience but it's also made me act and confident to fix their problems. I just love the slogan of Who are we ?? NSS while clicking the photo. Special Thanks to our Council who had put so much effort into bringing people together and creating a family. I loved working on projects and especially the making posters (not good at this but i tried well my best). Another best part of our NSS is the NSS dance our cultural event Sojourn we all gathered everyday before the final performance and we have created a great memories for life. The only place where I felt equality. That affection, those million-dollar smiles, the bond with them is something like an asset to me. I know this may sound boring as it is too long. But, this was the best experience of my life. I have spent my nss journey with the best people. Blessed with the best.",

        "Joining NSS has been one of the best decisions I have made in college. Words will not be enough in expressing how these two years passed. From the recruitment to the way NSS rules were taught to us till the last project, it has been a great journey throughout. I am quite struck by the incredible experiences I’ve had, the lessons I've learned, and the relationships I've formed.During SE we had a few projects online then after a few months the offline projects started. I still remember how I have been late for each project and was scolded for the same. NSS is not just about strictness, everything eventually ends up with fun and amazing memories only. NSS has taught me punctuality and discipline. I never thought I would start working with people who were initially just like any other volunteer to me but have ended up becoming a FAMILY. Our batch was fortunate enough to experience the NSS Camp. This is one of the things which will be unforgettable. Each day brought new experiences that one never had. Not to forget the NSS Dance Rehearsals during sojourn. The amount of fun and Bonds formed during it can match no level. Kudos to the current council as well, they performed a splendid job. The memories created together will always hold a special place in my heart. The bonds formed will only grow stronger. JAI HIND!",

        "JAI HIND! The reasons why I signed up to become an NSS volunteer could probably be put to words, but what I got back from NSS… it’s beyond just words - it’s a feeling  Well to get started I was very bored. I among many others started my engineering life in dire times where we were more concerned about ourselves than trying to do cool stuff students are supposed to do in colleges according to Bollywood (Student Of The Year is a lie). I wasn’t very socially active with what was happening in my online college, but I finally decided to do something about it, right after all bodies in the college closed off their membership forms! It’s when I found out about TCET NSS UNIT and what everything looked more appealing to me than the college admissions itself. Without having any idea of what I was signing up for, every twists and turns in my volunteer-ship was filled with surprises and some of the fantastic moments of my life: whether it was the recruitment or making a difference around my society - online AND offline, participating in various projects which mattered a lot to the people I wouldn’t have met otherwise, the feedbacks, the bonding with fellow volunteers regardless of year and department, and becoming a part of THE NSS FAMILY. From recruitment to being the SE volunteers struggling to turn on our cameras, to attending my first offline project of vaccination drive – from becoming the Lazy Buddies to rocking the stage at Sojourn (TWICE) – from being the ones who got recruited to becoming to ones who recruited – from giving the NSS CAMP's FOMO to attending the 7-day NSS CAMP – there are too many words, people, and memories to fit this page, but here are the ones who are responsible for making these two years INCREDIBLE: Bhavik, Vishakha, Ameya, Ashmit, Shantanu and Aashvi – for making the first volunteers I ever interacted with worth it and recruiting me into NSS which brought out my spirit of a volunteer. Om, Khushi, Mayank, Priyanshu, Vaishnavi, Chhayank, Praveer and Rohit – the eight pair of shoulders who introduced us to various projects and ensured we had the best memories starting with our offline projects. Kamal, Tanisha, Aryan, Charvi, Maniprakash, Pranali, Sumit and Yash – providing us TE volunteers with various opportunities during recruitment and projects as well as bringing us our best memories of all time in the NSS Camp! And lastly to all volunteers – without whom this family would have never been complete. I am in depth to you all for making these two years unforgettable JAI HIND!",

        "Jai Hind! These two years of my life where I was the part of NSS family was incredibly grateful. In these 2 years I learned 3 things discipline, punctuality and respecting others.In these span I have earned many friends, well I can’t say friends but now they are my family, my NSS family. I also learned how to work for society selflessly, ”Not me but You” ,and how to find happiness in small things. I honestly was an introvert person but from the day 1, from recruitment process to last project I have noticed a drastic change in myself, I have turned into an extrovert person, a person who loves to be with peoples, who loves to talk a lot. NSS has taught me, wait gaa ke sunati hu “Kisi ki muskurahaton pe ho nisar,Kisi ka dard mil sake to Ie udhaar” that is to be someone’s reason for happiness, a reason to bring smile on their face, stand for someone who is in pain and be there support system, old age home visit where we tried cheering them up and tried to bring smile on there face. Talking about Sojourn, performance ka pata nahi but practice time were worth remembering, voh masti voh dance voh “samosa samosa” voh sab I will really gonna miss. Lastly about the camp, use bare mai kya hi bolu “woh din bhi kya din the”, vaise toh “what happens in NSS stays in NSS” but still I can say etna ki voh morning exercise, voh village tak chal ke jana, voh sath mai ek plate mai share kar ke khana, voh raat to games ka session, voh DJ night, voh punishments, aur bahut kuch, but sabse jyada yaad aayegi voh room ke andar wali memories, voh dumb sharas, voh bathroom ke liye bricking’s. Seriously those 7 days were the best. And finally, about the councils who seems very strict, but were the actual shield for us, pata nahi kitna suna hoga unhone ne humari wajah se, kitne consequences jhele hai pata nahi, but yes, they were the great leaders always stood for us. Now that my journey is ending with NSS, Naina Talwar(YJHD) kaa dialogue yaad aa raha hai,”Takleef hui lekin iss baar khushi bhi thi ki apne saath wapas yaadon ka ek bada sa suitcase le jaa rahi thi…jinhein mai kabhi nahi bhul paungi”. Feeling bad ki journey khatam ho rahi hai but those beautiful memories will always gonna stay with me, and I doubt I would ever forget it. But “Once a volunteer always a volunteer” so abhi toh nahi chod rahi mai NSS ka sath. Honestly speaking these 2 years were the best part of my engineering years. I will miss my NSS nuclear family. There is no goodbyes for us though, u all will always be in my heart! Jai Hind!",

        "Toh chaliye shuru karte hai… The journey in NSS is like a roller coaster of emotions (the real NAVRAS) and a slideshow of memories for me. Right from the recruitment days it was clear that it was not like some ordinary committee/club but it was something different, something way more interesting. NSS taught us the true meaning and importance of discipline and unity, while also providing complementary fun and joyful moments. I cannot imagine how monotonous and dull engineering would be if I hadn’t been a part of NSS. Being the JC was also an amazing expedition which obviously came along with lots of work, but it’s amazing how such tedious work didn’t feel hectic (thoda bohot lagta tha but nvm) I guess credit goes to my fellow JCs and our dear Council. The best part started when the things began in offline mode from SOJOURN Dance to NSS ki Holi to SE recruitment to the residential camp and much more, each and every event was filled with sheer uncertainty and unexpectedness. I hope that the legacy of the TCET NSS UNIT continues for future batches so that they also could be a part of this one of a kind experience. Ab saari cheezein toh nahi bata sakta idhar because “What happens in NSS stays in NSS''. But believe me when I say it, the experience of being a part of the NSS UNIT is unparalleled and is the best thing that has happened to me in TCET.",

        "2 years in nss just passed in a blink of an eye. Enjoyed every project that I attended. Sometimes going to projects reduces stress giving by the college . Nss gave much more exposure to society and what an individual can provide to society. The best part apart from the project was the recruitment phase of  SE. I really enjoyed  that movement and I wish I could take their recruitment once more . And how can I forget camp of NSS the best memories of every NSS volunteer and also the dance of nss third year. At last I would like to say that it was the right decision for me  to join nss. There is much more to tell but I would like to end this on a short note. Maybe this is the last feedback of mine in NSS but I will really miss this 2 years of volunteering in NSS. JAI HIND !!!",

        "The BEST thing that happened in my engineering life was getting recruited into TCET NSS UNIT, NSS has given me many things. I wasn't sure where to start or what to say, but I'll try to cover most of my experiences. In the first phase of our recruitment where our colleges were in online mode, our seniors connected with us via Zoom/google meetings jaha humara recruitment ho raha tha and I was totally shocked ki ye kya ho raha hai, like everyone knows ki NSS ka recruitment sabse alag and hatke hota hai but humari batch jo sirf admission ki procedure ke liye college aayi thi baki we had no clue about anything, at first, the activities like namak khana and singing felt like torture, but we soon realized that those were the moments that brought us closer together. Somehow I got recruited into TCET NSS UNIT because maine meeting me Rohit Yadav jo hamare council the ( i didn’t knew of course sab logo ne random names se rename kya tha) unko hi cross question kar liya tha and itna hi nhi also I was elected as junior council for TCET NSS UNIT on 31/08/2021. And there I started my journey for NSS. In the beginning, it was very tough for me to work in the online mode that too with all unknowns but all thanks to our 8 councils and of course JC BOYZZ Aryan & Sahil. Working with them never felt like I was working with strangers, despite the online format. We developed a great bond(late night meetings IYKYK ). I still remember 18th Feb 2022, which was my first offline project about which I was super excited, because I was always eager to attend offline projects. I still remember it was Blood Donation Camp in collaboration with Lions Club and on my first project, I committed a mistake by wearing NSS t-shirt before the start of the project ☠️ . Later, we met all the other volunteers in person, whom we had only seen in online meetings. It was great to finally put faces to names, like 'Oh, you're Samridhh!😂. Most of our journey of the second year was completed in online mode, but there were a few moments that we can't forget. One is Sojourn where we set the stage on fire with our passion and energy. I still remember that 1 minute 50 seconds of our performance as SE was my first and best dance performance(Top Lessi poddi ), special thanks to Krutish, Vishakha, Ashvi and all TE who helped us to set that dance, and then there comes Holi 2k22 , where we were surprised by our TE and council members which was AWESOME ⭐ and with lots of new friends we completed our tenure as SE Volunteers. Then, as we started attending offline projects, we met everyone and our bond with everyone was getting stronger. The best memory of TE was NSS CAMP ❣️, that one week, one hundred connections, one thousand emotions, one lakh jokes, and one million memories from 12/01/23 to 18/01/23 will always be carved into everyone’s heart. We spent a whole week without phones or the internet, and it was scary how quickly time flew by. With great pleasure, I am writing this feedback for our TCET NSS UNIT. As a NSS volunteer, I have had the opportunity to serve the community and positively impact the lives of people around me. The journey has been a fulfilling one, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to everyone who has been a part of it. The two years of my journey with NSS have been nothing short of awesome. It has been a wonderful experience working alongside like minded individuals who share a passion for service and a commitment to making a difference in the world. From organizing blood donation camps and health drives to conducting awareness campaigns and environmental initiatives, every activity has been a rewarding and enriching experience that has helped me grow both personally and professionally. I was an introvert in my first year, but just because of the opportunities I got from NSS and, of course, constant support from my councils, I developed lots of soft skills. I even got a chance to become Joint Discipline Secretary of TCET only because of NSS and the exposure I got from NSS being a junior council. Thank You Chhayank, Khushi, Mayank, Om, Praveer, Priyanshu, Rohit, and Vaishnavi for giving me this opportunity to be a part of this great NSS FAMILY. Once a Volunteer, always a Volunteer.

How did this happen ? *Intense Flashbacks* 2nd year ki jawan umar me dusro se behter banane ke liye race me bhagta vidhyarthi. Mere samne aayi ek opportunity NSS NSS *10 marks* *Govt certificate* Naajane kab me iske andar sama gya. Pehel pehel me oscar vali acting karke me Junior council me select hogya .Socha sab online hai to ab life sorted !! Haashh ............... (kaash aisa hota) Fir aaya kamar tod kaam ka bojh, pad gaye mere dimag me moch. Kaam krte krte kab online ek saal beet gya pata hi nhi chala. Is ek saal me JC ke rath ke 3 ghode fix hogye. Jab offline hamare projects shuru hue, is rath se sath utre hum NSS ke maidan me jaha kai aur naye chehre dekhne mile. *Fast forward to present* Ab koi anjan nhi, feeki koi jaan nhi Jinhe me kosta tha har lamha, ab basti hai unme jaan meri Har pal judta gya ,har shakz milta gya aakhir me fir bhi saath rahe bani mehfil jo rangeen yahi Naajane kab vo introvert, shy, kam bolne vala ,antisocial sahil kab khud ka hi mirror image ban gya. NSS me meri journey ek moment nahi balki meri new beginning thi. Jo mein hamesha se ban na chahta tha NSS me aake me vo bana. Har ek project me kaam krke,har ek nayi cheez explore krke maine yeh realize kiya ki yeh project aur exploration asal me meri life ke baare me tha. Har din, har lamha, har baat, jazbat judte gye aur bangayi meri nayi kahani. Kab me SE se TE bangya reh gya me anjan, Kab TE ka ye vakt khatam hua na paaya me pehchan Ab yaad aati sunday ki subah ,na bajta hai ye phone Bole uth sahil, kidhar hai!! project me aa varna began Well well ,the person who experienced all this and the one who is writing this is different,the old me would have never ever thought i could have said such words for anyone ever in my life.

Matlab bhai jo expect nhi kiya tha wo sab experience karne mila . I think ye NSS ki khasiyat hi hai ki ye bohot hi unexpected hai😉. Matalab ham soch te kuch aur hai par uska outcome kuch aur hi hota hai. Jaise NSS ka koi bhi project boring nhi lagega aapko😌. bhalehi aapko bas ek poster banana ho ya koi survey lenaho. Sare project mai mazza aata hi hai and mereliye tho jaise naye project aata gaye waise naye dost bannae hmari dosti gehri hoti gai and projects ka mazza bhi maaz tho aana hi tha. Do sal sabkeliye kuch na kuch unexpected laya haiand ham aur hmare councils hamesha yehi try karte rehenge ki aur kaise sabko kuch unexpected late rahe. Hmare do salomaise pehla saal tho pura online nikla . Lekin fir bhi naye dost banana mai ye sirf online mile rukawat nhi bani. Online hokar bhi sirf ek screen se bate karke bhi naye dost bansakte hai ye hamne pehle saal mai sikhliya tha. Jaise mujhe aaj bhi yaad hai ki ek yoga ka project tha hmare. Hame kya laga bas ek siminar hoga and bas on kareke baith janan hai. Fir pata chala ki hame bhi yoga karna hai. Ye hamne nhi socha tha. Lekin maza aaya mera ek dost tho yoga karte karte apne hi bed se girgay tha ye dekhkar ham itna hase itna hase ki mujhe tho merea camera bandh karna pada kyu ki haste haste mai khud na mere bed se gir jata. NSS ka council banana ki jab mujhe opportunity mili tho maine wo leli without any second thoughts issmai mere council ka mai dilse shukriya karta hu ki mujhe unhone ye opportunity di and mujhe islayak samjha ki mai ye karpau. Council banne ka experience mereliye both hi eye opening tha. I mean I got to know what actually happens bts . And turst mi ye bohot hi jyada mehnat ka kaam hai. Matlat agar NSS aap sirf ek volunteer ki najro se dekho tho aakp sare projects mai aana hai kaam karna hai waha and ghar chalejana hai which is a challenge in itself no doubt, but begin an council wo project volunteers keliye lana was a like a mission impossible kinda scenario in itself. From permission from clg to the permission from the police official or the MLA or any big person the process is very tiring. Ye mujhe nhi pata tha ki NSS ka bas ek simple sa project jo clg mai karna hai uskee piche bhi itna sara kaam and efforts lagte hai . But as I said NSS is the treasure of experience and unexpectedness. Abhi jyada bol kae mai kisiko emotional nhi karna chahta ya khoud hona chahta hu😎 (chasme ke andar aansu Chup aarha hu). Lekin bas itna kahunga ki NSS ne mujhe bohot sari chize di hai and I will be always in debt of it. As we always say Once a volunteer always a volunteer. JAI HIND !!!!!",

Aur council hone ke saath hum sab ko ye makesure karna pad ta tha he Volunteers Projects ke saath saath masti mazak bhi kare aur aapas me bonding badhaye…Magar NSS ke parivaar ke sabse aache bonding ya friendship NSS ke Special Residential camp me he bane te hai. As councils camp ke preparation was major task for all of us, but hum aathe preparation to volunteers ke dinner ke he chinta karne me he chale gaye, projects bhi kar vane hote hai vo to hum bhul he gaye the…. For me camp ka sabse best project was School teaching and kite making.

Ab aate hain story k climax pe…Council interviews -Tbh meko council toh ban na tha but lag nhi rha tha ban paungi …lekin baki TE ko mujhpe, mujhse zada bharosa tha k bhai Tu toh banegi hi ….woh council interview toh mai kabhi nahi bhool sakta …As it was the “first official interview “ of my life …..ab ussme kya kya hua yeh toh nhi bata sakti 😉…as “What Happens In NSS Stays In NSS”…lekin voh phase bhi worth it that Bhai ….Right from giving interviews to waiting for results voh time bhaisaab Aisa dhak dhak ho re la tha kya hi batao….but Umeed nhi chod di ..n finally ban hi gae Student Leader …..sunkee khushi toh bhaut hui thi …lekin isske saath saath jo responsibilities aa rhi thi uska itna andaza toh nhi tha tbh …voh kehte haina k hathi ke dant khane k kuch Aur ,Aur dikhane k kuch Aur hote hai …iss phrase ka real mtlb council ban ki samajh aya …k hamare ex councils kaise sab handle krte honge kyuki hume as a volunteer toh sab easy peezy hi lagta tha …but ek 2 ghante k project k peeche ki 1 week ki planning ka andaza toh council ban k hi hua ….Council ban na was the best thing that happened to me in TCET for sure 😍…Jitna Council banke seekha hai shyd hi kabhi seekhane milta ….”Mai se hum tak ka safar suhana toh tha”❤ ….HUM 8 ko ek humare councils ne banaya hai no doubt their guidance has been the best thing for us for sure!!!…SOJOURN -isss cheez ka besabri se intezaar kiya tha Aur voh mauka aaya bhi .Right from giving auditions to taking auditions and setting the dance for the whole UNIT bhautttt maza aaya. Sojourn practice k din was one of the best days in this journey …Kabhi socha nahi tha k 100 logo ko dance sikhana padega …n no doubt the outcome was worth it …SE ne toh macha diya tha Aur TE ki toh kya hi baat krni Ab aate hai story ki ending par Aur ending toh emotional hoti hi hai …Mai baat kr rhi “NSS RESIDENTIAL CAMP” ki …Life k best 7 days ..I would say camp hi tha jisme hum aatho ki bonding Aur strong hue …voh volunteers ka dhyan rakhna ,unka khana peena,sona har cheez ka intezaam karna ..kabhi bhi volunteer ko koi issue ho fir raatke 3 kyu na bj rhe ho …unke parents ki tarah unka khayal rakhna, projects krvana ,sab sahi ho rha h k nahi uska dhyan rakhna….in 7 dino me bhauttt kuch seekhne ko mila …Aur yeh camp Successful hua bcoz of our volunteers SE n TE ..Special thanks to TE mates ..As we quoted “RAATEIN BEET JAYENGI BAATEIN YAAD AAYENGI” -sahi toh kaha tha humne 😭 Last but not the least …I would like to say ,This journey has taught me a lot …Dukh toh bhaut ho rha k yeh safar khatam ho rha lekin as we say “Once a volunteer, Always a volunteer “ ..bas is cheez k saath hi aage badungi… n I hope k SE bhi yeh legacy carry forward krega.

        "Jai Hind! Allow me tell y’all about a roller coaster that I had sat on without thinking twice, the jump I had made blindly and head first. NSS was always a part of the plan, uss plan ka step 1 tha Recruitment. For a shy SE kid, it was a challenge of a lifetime. Anokhe kisse sunne the jis safar ke baare me, woh mehsoos bhi kar liya. But today if I am asked to speak of it, it is definitely a memory I cherish with utmost gratitude. Haste-khelte, ghirte-sambhalte, naye dost banaate-banaate nikal gaya online humara pehla saal. Par picture abhi baaki thi mere dost! TE ke shuruwaat me, interval ke baad, shuru hui ek daud: Council bann ne ki daud. Iraada: haan, plan: nada. Par Geet ne kaha tha “aisa lagg raha tha kuch galat ho raha ho, jaise koi train chhot rahi ho” and I felt that. I was literally the last person to append my name on the list made for interview rounds. Khoon, paseena, upar waale ka saath aur sabki duaaon ke saath bann gayi main Admin Head! Par asli khel toh abhi baaki tha, jiske baare me hum 8 naadan parindon ko koi idea nahi tha. There is nothing our senior council have not helped us with. Definitely can’t not give them an honorary mention. Apne bacchon jaise hi rakha, sab sikhaaya, chillaya, rulaya, par saath nahi chhoda. First project ke pehle ke jitters, major college events me TCET NSS UNIT ko represent karne ka pride, Sojourn me perform karne ki excitement, aur most importantly NSS Residential Camp organize karne ka pressure, shayad hum 8 council members humesha ke liye apne dil me bandh ke chalenge. It was tough par at the end of the day, volunteers ko enjoy karta dekh sab worth it lagne lag gaya. As Kamal says and I quote, “Yehi baatein toh baadme yaad aayengi”. Pranali ka sabko taklu bulana, Tanisha ka chilla chillakar thak jaana, Aryan ka har jagah jaake tiffin khaana, Yash ka har cheez me bacchat karana, Mani ka hamesha mujhe bhajiya pav khaane leke jaana, Kamal ka SOM lab waala drama, Sumit ka daraane ke liye aankh dikhaana aur aakhir SABKA ek saath rehna. It is safe to say ki chaahe kuch yaad rahe na rahe, yeh cheeze hamesha rahengi. As this tremendously beautiful journey approaches it’s end on paper, I am proud to say that I would not have been the person I am today without NSS and everybody who has been a part of this journey with me. I am immensely grateful from the bottom of my very heart. “Once a volunteer, always a volunteer” they said, ab samajh aane lag gaya hai kyu. And in the very end, I would like to thank me, for believing in me. Teehee. So much love and gratitude, now and always. Jai Hind!",

        "JAI HIND! Tho chaliye shuru karte hai iss behtarin Safar ko.. Socha na tha ki NSS ke 2 saal mai pehla feedback idhar dunga!! Agar mai batau tho Mera recruitment itna hard nahi tha but maja bohot ayya n jo experience Mila vo shayad he kabhi milega.. Jin logo ko kabhi dekha bhi nahi Jin logo se kabhi Mila bhi nahi vo log ajj mere ek life a hissa baan chuke hai... Yeh hoti hai NSS ki 2 saal ki journey You make bonds with people and never lose them... Agar mai bolu ki NSS he hai jisne mujhe bohot kuch sikhaya tho vo bolna galat nahi hoga. Sojourn ke dance mai ek dum end mai khade hoke dance karne se leke next year he front mai dance karne ka Safar pura kiya hai.. ek year mai volunteer se leke dusre year mai council ka Safar bhi pura kiya hai. Jo level ka confidence ayya hai na life mai by God mujhe kabhi kabhi khud pe bharosa nahi hota hai ki kya yeh wahi Mani hai jisko bohot Ganda walla stage fear tha or jisko 10 logo ke samne bolne mai he halat kharab ho jati thi. But jab maine socha ki chalo abhi kisi body ka tho fissa bannte hai tho sabse pehle maine mere dost n mere senior n NSS ke council jo ki ek he insaan hai Chhakany usse pucha ki kya lu bhai batao jara tho bola ki NSS mai ajja sorted hai mai bola thik n recruitment mai ayya select(Meri selection hogayi hai? ) hua phir tho bhai online meet pe meet hue jaa rahe hai phir jab ek saal khatam hua tho socha ki abb tho council banne ka try karta hu usske liye bhi interviews diye bohot Sara drama hua phir mai baan Gaya Council (Meri selection hogayi hai?) Or haa Council banne ka Mera motto bhi bata deta hu baas yehi likhna tha NSS ki magazine pe ki(I never thought that my first NSS feedback would be here) n vo maine likh Diya hai tho baas abhi Shanti hai 😂. Phir mai mila Kamal baby, Sumit the bhojpuri partner, Aryan and Yash the Og duo, Charvi the Tutu, Tanisha begum and Pranali buddy jo gaane ke lyrics nahi bhulti & mai Mani from Nallasopara jisko hamesha Ghar jaldi Jana rehta hai kyu ki train mai bhid hoti hai bhai . Agar mai bolu tho NSS ka camp tho mai kabhi nahi bhulne walla vo 7 din khoshih bhi karlu tho bhi nahi bhulne walla and i hope Jo bhi NSS volunteers jo yeh padh rahe honge n jo camp gaye honge unka bhi yehi maana hoga. With the last motto of our TCET NSS UNIT ' Once a volunteer, always a volunteer ' ke sath mai apna Feedback yaha he samapt karta hu and Sabhi NSS volunteers ke liye mere taraf se bada walla .

        "JAI HIND! Jab college aaye the toh pehle hee din se online batch hone ki wajah se koi khaas interest tha nahi kisi bhi cheez main lagta tha ki covid main hee engineering ke 4 saal nikal jaayenge aur basss engineering ke maze bas films main dekhne waala cheez reh jaayegi……… First year main bataya gaya the ki next year se clubs wagerah main participate kar paaaoge and sochte ki kaha jaaye tab tak second year aaa gaya and clubscommittees join karne ki last date nikal bhi gayi thi! Ananya ke saath basss decide kar liya ki yaaar abb chaahe joh club yaaa committee ka form circulate hoga basss fill karna hain!! And abbb isse luck kahe yaa kuch aur par ussi din NSS ka registration form aaya tha 3 Din ka recruitment sunke honestly bacckout karne ka mann kiya but College lie ke maze waala bhoot joh sarr pe the usne fil karwa hee diya form ! Recruitment se leke SE volunteer ka safar sabse khoobsurat the jaha ek time tha lagta tha kya log,kya dosti yeh sab toh abbb hone se raha se abbb dekho I have met the best people of my life and that’s all because of NSS.Woh ek saal as a volunteer ne bohot kuch sikhaaya and woh I’m sure hum main se koi nahi bhulega!! Bohot saari cheeze thi joh pehli baar ki thi chaahe who oldage home ka visit ho yaaa phir Traffic Signal pe khade hoke dance! Har ek project humesha khaas raha hain and itne logo se baate aur dosti agar aaj college main hain toh who NSS ki wajah se! Abb baat aati hain as a Council ki itna kuch second year main dekha tha and itna involved the NSS main toh bohot mann karta tha ki yaar Council banke ek baar toh yeh sab manage karna hain! Thanks to the wonderful SE volunteers for understanding and pyaari TE for supporting. Jab hum sab 8 pehli baar ek saath kaam karne lage the tab kisi ko kuch samajh nahi aata tha ki kya kare ek dusre ke saath kaise kaam kare but abbb pata chal gaya hain ki Tutu ki galat format dekhke OCD jaag jaati hain, Tanisha bichaari chilla chillake thakk gayi hain and abbb bohot chid machti hain use!! Mani toh jaisa nahi banna chaahta tha waisa bann gaya hain jispe use bhi vishwas nahi hota!! Yash bichaara finance ka file bana banake thakk gaya hain and Aryan ko basss jaldi ghar jaana hota hain! And finally, Kamla jaisa bolta hain ki “Yahi Toh Game Hain!!” pehle lagta tha ek saal kaise nikalega aur aaj as a Council apna last feedback likh rahi hoon. It’s been a journey of its own and grateful for things to unfold the way did!! Second year Pranali took a wise wise decision to fill that form and thank God she did! Hoping to have this NSS Family as an integral part forever because Once A Volunteer Always A Volunteer!! JAI HIND!",

        "JAI HIND! Mai apna feedback iss line se start karunga “JO KABHI NAHI KIYA VO NSS ME KIYA” life k sab se yaadgaar 2 saal. Ab feedback dena hai toh 1st day se start karna padega i.e recruitment ka din 😎 , pata toh kuch tha nahi NSS k bareme chala gaya online meet me time pass k liye online college tha aur karne k liye bhi kuch nahi tha, mujhe laga kuch boring sa recruitment rahega puchege tell me about yourself ye vo but kabhi nahi socha tha NSS ka recruitment kuch aisa hoga matlab sab se alag aur sab se best itne maje kiye aur dost bhi bann gaye, gaya tha time pass k liye but recruitment k baad aisa lag raha tha ki kaash select ho jaau aur ho bhi gaya aur NSS ki journey start hui. Join karte hi hamare TE ne darana chalu kiya councils k samne ache se rehna kuch galti nahi jo bhi bole sunna sab baat aur masti nahi karna, but online tha toh humko bhi bahot masti thi toh councils ne chillaya bhi bahot aur samjhaya and in few weeks sab line pe aagaye. Pehla saal toh aadha online nikal gaya but humlog bahot jada wait kar rahe the offline projects ka kyu ki aisa kuch kabhi nahi kiya tha life me, aur college khulte hi hue bhi offline projects and itne dost bane aur itne maje kiye kya batau, projects k baad extra samosa lena ye koi nahi bhulega but milta nahi tha vo alag baat hai kyu hi SE wale the hum but jo offline projects ka experience tha kabhi nahi bhoolega koi bhi, ye sab karte karte sojourn aagaya aur dance aata nahi tha aur kabhi kiya bhi nahi tha toh dekhne gaya tha practise but councils ne bola tu bhi karega (“Start majboori me kiya tha lenkin fir maja aane laga”) start me dar laga but fir dekha aur bhi gande dancers hai toh maja aane laga. Fir aata hai hamara 3rd year😎, councils k recruitment ka msg aaya toh soch ek try maar leta hu aur laga toh nahi tha banunga but bann gaya. Council banne k baad pata chala ki kitna hard hota hai ye sab manage karna, but hamare councils hamesha help karne k liye the best part is council experience jo sab ne share kiya aur usse bahot kuch seekhne mila. Aur ab aata hai NSS ka sab se best part jo ki 7 din ka camp hai, kisne socha tha ye 7 din life k sabse best moments me se ek hoge, itne maje kisi ne nahi kiye hoge, ye 7 din itna ache the ki ek baar wapis experience karna chahta hu mai, aur camp ki ek line jo koi nahi bhoolega i.e “RAATEIN BEET JATI HAI, YAADEIN YAAD AATI HAI !” ye poore college life ki one of the best memories me se ek hai. Aur hum sojourn ko kaise bhool sakte hai vo bhi 3rd year k matlab ghaghra pehen k jo naache hai sab ladke shyd hi kahi kiya hoga kisi ne once in life time experience hai jo aur kahi nahi milega and council dance isse sabse jada dar tha but ye bhi hogaya thanks to tanisha and pranali jinhone NSS dance me char chand laga diye.NSS join karne k baad bahot kuch sikhne mila aur bahot dost bhi bane aur bahot achi memories bhi. Aur bhi bolna hai lekin ek page ki limit hai so yahi khatam karta hu. Thank you NSS for everything, my journey with NSS has been a fulfilling one, and I am proud to have been a part of such a noble cause. JAI HIND !!!!",

Kaafi log NSS 10 marks ke lia join krte h pr mera case alag tha muze bs mere comfortzone break karke socialize hona tha islia NSS join kia. NSS ne pehechan di kal tak koi nhi janta tha muze aaj har koi janta. NSS ka safar NSS special recruitment se chalu hua jiske baaremien phele koi idea nhi tha exactly kya hota mere case mein recruitment kaafi light gaya may be because mein dekhta serious hu😂.Mera phela offline project vaccination drive se chalu hua tha jo utna acha nhi tha usmein humare super council aye the aur hum unhe jaante nhi the😅. First aur Second year online tha so rarely kuch dost the NSS mein aane ke baad itne dosto baane ki abh count tak yaad nhi. Life mein jo jo nhi kia tha sabh NSS mein aakr kia Dance se lekr ghaghra se lekar CAMP ki planning tak and to be specific iss saal ka Soujourn ka Dance life ka phela dance tha mera. NSS ka phela year toh almost pura online nikalgaya. Second year chalu hote hi Council ka interview dia jo kia haadse jyadha bura gaya tha. Par by god grace mein Council bangaya. Council bante hi phela change was Mein , Muze to Hum, Hume Council baane ke baad phela month was dm hectic as sabh offline open horaha tha aur sabh kaam pile up hone laga tha par dheere dheere sabh normalise hogaya. NSS mein aakar Saath Sitaro ka saath mila Humesha josh mein rhene waale Kamal ka , Humesha chill dude rhene waale Maniii ka , Humesha calm minded rhene waale Patil Boi ka, Humesha Full charge rhene waali Hey Comps! ka (Pranali)❤️ ,Humesha iphone se project ke photos click krne waali Tanisha ka, Humesha helmet lekar aane waale Sumit ka , Humesha Sobo vibes dene waali Charvu ka . Iss safar mein humare 8 ideals ko hum kabhi nhi bhulsakte Om, Khushi, Mayank, Priyanshu, Vaishnavi, Chhayank, Praveer, Rohit . NSS mein aakar actually letters, reports, files kaise banate hai vo sikha. NSS ne bhot saare naye dost, memories, experiences dia jo zindagi bhar kaam ayenge. NSS ne muze introvert se extrovert banadia. NSS ki journey ka sabhse best part hota NSS RESIDENTIAL CAMP jo iss saal hum finally gaye. Normally 75 volunteers jaate hai isbar hum 102 volunteers lekar gaye. Expectations se kaafi jyadha TE se support mila during the Camp. NSS Camp mein NSS FAMILY iss words ka actual meaning pata chala. Iss safar mein kaafi ups and down dikhe pr conclusion was that humesha koi na koi solution miljata tha. Yeh safar asani se kaatgaya kyuki sabh saath the UNITY thi aisi hi unity humesha maintain rahe. Aise hi TCET NSS UNIT desh ke prati apna yogdan dete rahe. Bas conclusion mein yaahi bolna chahunga jo legacy NSS ne itne saalose maintain ki hai vo humesha maintain rahe . JAI HIND !!!",

        "As a less social person, I often found myself feeling like an outsider among my peers. I tended to gravitate towards solitary activities, preferring to spend my time alone watching movies, learning something new, or simply sitting quietly with my thoughts. Social situations made me uncomfortable, and I often felt like I didn't belong. That's when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and join NSS.Without a question, the best aspect of my experience was the recruitment procedure. I was able get exposure while engaging in a variety of activities by joining NSS, in addition to giving me a chance to give back to society. During the projects, I found myself engaging in teamwork and collaboration, something I had always shied away from. Working with fellow volunteers on community projects became a catalyst for personal growth. I discovered the joy of contributing to something larger than myself. The experience of organizing and Participating in a range of activities, including cleanliness drives, visits to old age homes, blood donations, and The Sojourn Dance, within the NSS has afforded me diverse settings and opportunities. These experiences have contributed to the development of my ability to effectively balance my commitment to serving others with the pursuit of personal fulfillment and enjoyment. One of the most surprising aspects was the support and camaraderie I found among my fellow volunteers. The shared goal of making a positive impact brought us together, and I realized that I wasn't alone in my journey.Being part of NSS has been one of the most significant experiences in my life. I believe everyone should consider dedicating a small portion of their lives to helping others. In doing so, you lose nothing but gain a unique and fulfilling kind of happiness.",
